# Spanning Tree: Parallel Spanning Tree

The code provides an implementation of parallel spanning tree
algorithms for SMPs, as a module for SIMPLE/SMP. This new randomized
algorithm and implementation has superior performance that for the
first-time achieves parallel speedup on arbitrary graphs (both regular
and irregular topologies) when compared with the best sequential
implementation for finding a spanning tree.
